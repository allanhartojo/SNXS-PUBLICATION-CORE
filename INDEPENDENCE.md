🕊️ Declaration of Independence & Neutrality

I. The Principle of Zero-Grant Development
The Sovereign Nexus (SNXS) framework and its associated L0-L1-L2 Publication Cores were developed with zero external grants, corporate sponsorship, or institutional funding. This was a deliberate choice by the Author & Steward to ensure that the foundational Cybernetic Invariants remain free from institutional capture, academic bias, or commercial pressure.

II. Favoring No One
Consistent with L0 Invariant 1 (No Irreversible Control), the SNXS safety envelope is designed to be structurally neutral. It does not work in favor of any specific actor, coalition, or ideology. Its only objective is the preservation of Epistemic Discipline and Human Sovereignty in the face of autonomous systems.

III. The Value of Independent Will
This framework is the result of independent research and raw will, synthesized from geometric and ecological principles rather than optimized for funder-driven metrics. By remaining independent of the "Grant Cycle," the Steward ensures that:

Integrity is Fixed: The Frozen Canon cannot be "unfrozen" by a change in sponsorship.

Alignment is Structural: Safety is enforced by the laws of cybernetics, not by the shifting policies of a central board.

Exit is Guaranteed: Because there are no stakeholders with "clawback" rights, the right to Fork and Exit remains absolute for all users.

IV. Patronage vs. Investment
While we are now seeking L3 Patronage, such support is strictly classified as a gift to the Sovereign Commons. Patronage grants the donor the prestige of supporting structural safety but confers no command authority, no governance rights, and no ability to alter the SNXS Invariants.
