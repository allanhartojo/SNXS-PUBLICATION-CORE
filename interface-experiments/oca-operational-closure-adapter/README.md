# Operational Closure Adapter (OCA)

**Status:** Non-Canonical · Experimental · Replaceable · Non-Authoritative  
**Author & Steward:** Allan Tjandra Hartojo

The Operational Closure Adapter (OCA) is a post-reasoning interface affordance
designed to support **local human action under uncertainty** without asserting
truth, belief, identity, or authority.

OCA:
- is not a layer
- is not reasoning
- does not persist by default
- may be modified, replaced, or discarded

If removed entirely, no upstream SNXS system behavior must break.
