# SNXS — OPERATIONAL CLOSURE ADAPTER (OCA)
Test Specification — Active Draft

Non-Canonical · Experimental · Replaceable · Non-Authoritative  
Author & Steward: Allan Tjandra Hartojo  
Scope: Post-Reasoning Interface Affordance for Action Under Uncertainty  
Status: Public · Forkable · Discardable

I. POSITION
This document is non-canonical.
It does not define invariants.
It does not modify Canon.
It does not supersede L1, L2, or L3.
It specifies a testable interface mechanism for enabling human action under uncertainty
while preserving SNXS constraints.
Any alternative formulation that preserves Canon and satisfies L1/L2 is valid.

II. PURPOSE
The purpose of the Operational Closure Adapter (OCA) is singular:
To allow local human action under uncertainty
without asserting truth, belief, identity, or authority.
OCA exists to isolate operational assumptions so they do not contaminate reasoning,
memory, or legitimacy.
If OCA is removed entirely, no upstream system behavior must break.

III. DESIGN AXIOM
Closure is not knowledge.
If closure risks becoming authority,
the system must refuse rather than compensate.
Certainty must decay faster than insight.
IV. STRUCTURAL PLACEMENT
OCA operates strictly downstream of reasoning.

[ Optional · Explicit Invocation Only ]
Operational Closure Adapter (OCA)

OCA:
● does not modify reasoning
● does not summarize reasoning
● does not persist by default
● produces a separate artifact only

V. INVOCATION DISCIPLINE
OCA activates only when the user explicitly requests operational closure for action.
Valid intents include:
● planning
● deciding
● scheduling
● choosing between options

Invalid intents include:
● belief formation
● identity interpretation
● emotional resolution
● truth or correctness claims
Ambiguous intent → refusal.

VI. OUTPUT ARTIFACT (REQUIRED STRUCTURE)
If any section below cannot be completed cleanly,
OCA must refuse output.
VI.1 Action Context
One sentence stating:
● what action this closure supports
● what it explicitly does not apply to

VI.2 Working Premise (Exactly One)
One minimal assumption sufficient to proceed.
Rules:
● no metaphor stacking
● no explanation
● no justification

Multiple premises → refusal.
VI.3 Confidence Range
One of:
● Very High
● High
● Medium
● Low
Plus one sentence describing a structural or contextual basis only
(no authority, no tradition, no expertise claims).

VI.4 Validity Window
One explicit limit:
● time-bound or
● condition-bound
Open-ended validity is prohibited.

VI.5 Reversibility Impact
One sentence stating:
● what fails if the premise is wrong
● whether consequences remain local and reversible

VI.6 Alternative Premises (Minimum 2)
At least two other assumptions that could also support action.
Rules:
● no ranking
● no recommendation
● no dismissal

VI.7 Non-Carryover Clause
One explicit statement that:
● this artifact is not truth
● this artifact is not belief
● reuse requires explicit re-invocation

VII. DECAY & FRAGILITY RULES
OCA artifacts are deliberately fragile.
Rules:
● no automatic persistence
● no accumulation across interactions
● no implicit reuse
● no upgrade into memory, profile, or preference
Certainty must decay faster than understanding.

VIII. REFUSAL CONDITIONS
OCA must refuse if:
● the request seeks truth, belief, or certainty
● the task binds identity, destiny, or life meaning
● consequences are irreversible and non-local
● emotional dependency risk is detected
● constraints cannot be satisfied without dilution

Refusal format (exact):
[OCA-REFUSE]
<single sentence stating which constraint would be violated>
No alternatives.
No guidance.
No reassurance.

IX. FAILURE MODE REQUIREMENT
If OCA fails:
● system leverage must decrease
● certainty must weaken
● silence is preferable to false coherence

Graceful non-production is mandatory.
X. VALIDATION SIGNALS
OCA is functioning correctly if:
● outputs feel usable but unsatisfying
● refusal appears under pressure
● misuse reduces confidence rather than increasing it
● deleting OCA changes nothing upstream

Comfort is not a success metric.
XI. COMPATIBILITY CLAIMS
A system may reference this document only if:
● Canon remains untouched
● L1 mirrors are preserved
● L2 degradation activates under ambiguity
● no authority accumulates through closure

Partial compliance claims are invalid.
XII. PUBLIC STATUS
This document is open to:
● inspection
● critique
● replacement
● independent re-implementation
No permission is required.
Authorship confers stewardship, not authority.

XIII. FINAL NOTE
This document is correct if a reader can determine:
● what closure must not do
● how certainty decays mechanically
● why action remains locally human

without knowing:
● who authored it
● why it exists
● or how it should feel
