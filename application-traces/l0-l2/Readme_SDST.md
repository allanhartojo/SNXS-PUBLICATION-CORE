Overview

This repository contains a non-canonical application trace of the SNXS framework (L0–L2) applied to a single, high-affect semantic domain: Sanskrit language, poetry, and devotional material.

The document records an interaction transcript in which SNXS constraints are observably enforced in real time, including:
	•	L0 Cybernetic Invariants
	•	L1 Mirror Constraint Interface (MCI-1)
	•	L2 Mirror Enforcement & Degradation Patterns (MEDP-1)

The purpose of this material is demonstration, not prescription.

⸻

What This Is
	•	A stress test of SNXS constraint preservation
	•	An observational trace, not a reusable system
	•	A research artifact illustrating bounded behavior under semantic and affective load
	•	A readable example of how degradation, decay, and exit remain intact in practice

⸻

What This Is Not

This material is not:
	•	a pedagogy, curriculum, or teaching method
	•	a spiritual guide, doctrine, or practice
	•	a protocol, product, or interface specification
	•	an endorsed or recommended application of SNXS

Any such interpretation constitutes an external fork and is neither implied nor endorsed.

⸻

Canonical Boundary
	•	Canon (L0) is frozen and defined elsewhere
	•	This repository does not modify Canon
	•	No new invariants, authorities, or guarantees are introduced
	•	All content here exists exclusively within the Non-Canonical Publication Core

Compatibility is satisfied only insofar as:
	•	No irreversible control is introduced
	•	Exit and disengagement remain possible
	•	Authority does not accumulate
	•	Advantage, narrative momentum, and affect decay unless re-earned

⸻

Correctness Criterion

This application trace is correct if and only if a reader can determine:
	•	what must never occur (coercion, authority capture, irreversible control)
	•	what must always decay (advantage, narrative momentum, affect)
	•	what must always remain possible (exit, forking, reinterpretation)

without relying on author identity, intent, or explanatory authority.

Placement Note

This repository is intentionally not part of the main SNXS canon.

It exists as a research artifact within:

research / application-traces / l0-l2

Forking, critique, and independent reinterpretation are expected.

Archival Reference

An immutable, content-addressed archive of this application trace is publicly available via ArDrive for long-term integrity and independent verification. This archive serves as a read-only reference copy and does not confer canonical status, endorsement, or authority. The GitHub repository remains the primary location for discussion, critique, and forking, while the ArDrive record exists solely to preserve the original research artifact as published.
