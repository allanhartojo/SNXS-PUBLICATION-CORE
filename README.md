### 🛠️ Interrogating the Canon (Transparency)
The SNXS framework relies on **Negative Definition** (what is forbidden) rather than Positive Definition (what is allowed). This creates a dense logical structure.

To verify the constraints without needing to be a systems architect, we encourage using LLMs to "interrogate" the text for failure modes.

**Recommended Prompt for Analysis:**
> "Act as a Systems Architect. Review these 'Canonical Constraints' (L0). Explain to me exactly what a founder is **forbidden** from doing under these rules. How would this system prevent a 'Rug Pull' or 'Capture' scenario by the original authors?"

*Note: AI models are tools for visualization and explanation, not formal security auditors. Rely on the Canonical text and cryptographic hashes for final verification.*
