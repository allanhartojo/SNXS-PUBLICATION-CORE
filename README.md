Structural observations on long-term systemic stability and safety protocols.

STATUS: OBSERVATIONAL / NON-ACTIVE

📘 Overview
This repository serves as a conceptual anchor for a research framework titled SNXS (Systemic Node-X Stability). The primary objective is to define a set of "Inertial Restraints" that prioritize the longevity of a system over its rapid growth. By focusing on structural constraints, we explore how systems can remain resilient against external entropy and internal decay.

🏛️ Research Methodology: Static Constraints
The SNXS framework operates on Inhibitory Logic. Instead of defining active growth trajectories, it focuses on identifying the boundaries of a "Stable Operational Environment."

Core Inquiry Areas:

Constraint-Based Architectures: How fixed rules prevent systemic capture.

Lindy Effect in Software: Designing logic that gains resilience through time.

Autonomous Stability: Reducing the dependency on centralized authorship over 10+ year horizons.

🧪 Analysis & Verification
For researchers looking to visualize the boundaries of these constraints, the documentation can be analyzed via standard semantic modeling tools.

Focus: Identify the limitations placed on "The Origin" to ensure horizontal stability.

Goal: Verify the system's ability to resist centralization or capture.
