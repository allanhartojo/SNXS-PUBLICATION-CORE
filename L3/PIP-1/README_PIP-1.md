What this is

SNXS — L3 PIP-1 (Public Interaction Profile) is a reference interaction surface for everyday, low-friction use of systems operating under the SNXS framework.

It defines how interaction should feel and degrade for public users —
not what is true, correct, or authoritative.

PIP-1 is designed for:
	•	everyday assistance
	•	emails, school and study help
	•	basic science and explanations
	•	administrative and practical tasks
	•	domain-specific modules (e.g. accounting, engineering, architecture, image creation)

⸻

What this is not

PIP-1 is not:
	•	Canon
	•	a protocol requirement
	•	a compliance standard
	•	a certification
	•	a governance mechanism
	•	a source of authority or mandate

Using or forking this document does not imply SNXS endorsement.

⸻

How it fits in the SNXS stack

PIP-1 operates entirely within:
	•	L0 — Canon (Cybernetic Invariants)
	•	L1 — Mirror Constraint Interface (MCI-1)
	•	L2 — Mirror Enforcement & Degradation Patterns (MEDP-1)

It does not modify or override them.

PIP-1 exists solely in L3, which is the non-canonical layer for:
	•	adoption
	•	legibility
	•	application surfaces

⸻

Design intent (plain language)
	•	Safety comes from structure, not user vigilance
	•	Interaction should be calm, humane, and easy to leave
	•	Ambiguity should soften outputs, not escalate them
	•	No interaction should create dependency, authority, or intensity

If something fails, it should fail gently.
