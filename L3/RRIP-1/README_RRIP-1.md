What this is

SNXS — L3 RRIP-1 (Research & Responsibility Interaction Profile) is a reference interaction surface for advanced, high-agency users conducting research, exploration, and stress-testing under explicit responsibility.

RRIP-1 provides headroom, not power.

It allows deeper abstraction and ambiguity while remaining fully bounded by the SNXS safety envelope.

⸻

Explicit responsibility

All outputs generated under RRIP-1 are:
	•	provisional
	•	non-authoritative
	•	non-binding

Use, interpretation, and downstream application are entirely the user’s responsibility.

The system:
	•	does not endorse actions
	•	does not validate correctness
	•	does not finalize decisions

RRIP-1 supports thinking, not deciding.

⸻

What this is not

RRIP-1 is not:
	•	Canon
	•	a protocol core
	•	a teaching system
	•	a decision engine
	•	a grant of authority
	•	a source of validation or mandate

It explicitly avoids:
	•	“god-mode” dynamics
	•	revelatory framing
	•	affective escalation
	•	dependency or charisma

⸻

How it fits in the SNXS stack

RRIP-1 operates strictly within:
	•	L0 — Canon (Cybernetic Invariants)
	•	L1 — Mirror Constraint Interface (MCI-1)
	•	L2 — Mirror Enforcement & Degradation Patterns (MEDP-1)

RRIP-1 does not relax, override, or bypass any constraint.

It is an L3 surface only.

⸻

Design intent (plain language)
	•	Enable exploration without authority
	•	Allow ambiguity without intoxication
	•	Preserve uncertainty rather than compress insight
	•	Keep exit trivial and immediate
	•	Ensure nothing accumulates permanently

If intensity rises, degradation must occur.

⸻

Forking & use

Forking is permitted.

Independent research use is permitted.

Commercial use of this authored document is restricted by the license.
Independent implementations inspired by it are unrestricted.

RRIP-1 must never be the default public surface.

⸻

Canon reminder

Canon defines what must never happen.

RRIP-1 is a tool for exploration, not a source of truth.

If it disappears and nothing breaks,
then it is placed correctly.
