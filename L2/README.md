# Layer 2 — Enforcement & Degradation Patterns

This directory contains non-canonical Layer 2 reference documents specifying enforcement and degradation patterns that preserve SNXS Layer 1 constraints under operational stress, partial compliance, or failure.

Layer 2 documents do not define invariants.  
They do not mandate implementations.  
They describe bounded responses to constraint pressure rather than optimization, authority, or control.

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **L0** defines invariants  
- **L1** defines interaction constraints  
- **L2** defines degradation and enforcement behavior  
- **L3**, if present, binds constraints to specific systems or machines  

Absence of L3 does not imply incompleteness.
