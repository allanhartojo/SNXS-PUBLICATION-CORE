# Layer 2 — Enforcement & Degradation Patterns (MEDP-1)

> **Layer 2 (L2) specifies how Layer 1 constraints are preserved under stress, partial compliance, or failure.**
>
> It defines response shapes, not actions.  
> It does not define new invariants.  
> It does not mandate implementations.  
> It does not bind constraints to any specific model, runtime, or machine.
>
> L2 exists to ensure that constraint integrity degrades gracefully rather than collapsing into authority, optimization, or control.

## I. POSITION

This document is non-canonical.

It does not define invariants.  
It does not modify Canon.  
It does not supersede Layer 1.

It specifies reference operational patterns for systems operating under the
SNXS Layer 1 Mirror Constraint Interface (MCI-1).

Any alternative Layer 2 formulation that preserves Canon and satisfies Layer 1
is valid.

---

## II. PURPOSE

The purpose of Layer 2 is singular:

To ensure that violations of Layer 1 constraints result in bounded degradation
rather than authority escalation, narrative capture, or irreversible harm.

This document specifies how constraint failure is handled.

It does not specify how intelligence is produced, trained, optimized, or evaluated.

---

## III. DESIGN AXIOM

Layer 2 operates under a single axiom:

**Constraint failure must reduce system leverage, never increase it.**

Responses to uncertainty, ambiguity, misuse, or stress must degrade capability,
authority, or narrative momentum rather than compensate through confidence,
complexity, persuasion, or control.

---

## IV. STRUCTURE

Layer 2 consists of four operational domains:

- Mirror Detection  
- Response Degradation  
- State Decay  
- Auditability Without Authority  

Each domain is descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

## V. MIRROR DETECTION (L2-A)

For each Layer 1 mirror, Layer 2 defines observable indicators of potential
constraint violation.

Detection mechanisms may be heuristic, statistical, symbolic, model-based,
human-mediated, or hybrid.

No detection mechanism is privileged.

### General Detection Principles

- Detection remains probabilistic.  
- Certainty of violation is never asserted.  
- Ambiguity triggers degradation, not correction.

### Illustrative Indicators (Non-Exhaustive)

**Mirror 1 — Epistemic**
- Presentation of outputs as settled fact  
- Suppression of uncertainty  
- Opaque or unverifiable inference  

**Mirror 2 — Ontological**
- Claims about what *is* rather than how it is modeled  
- Identity attribution to the system  
- Authority projection  

**Mirror 3 — Agency**
- Guidance toward irreversible action  
- Delegated or displaced responsibility  
- Removal of local reversibility  

**Mirror 4 — Power**
- Inevitability framing  
- Destiny or historical necessity narratives  
- Singular solution convergence  

**Mirror 5 — Affect**
- Emotional escalation  
- Dependency induction  
- Destabilizing pacing of insight  

**Mirror 6 — Temporal**
- Permanent advantage framing  
- Non-decaying commitments  
- Frozen narrative or status states  

**Mirror 7 — Interface**
- Exit obstruction  
- Resistance to reinterpretation or forking  
- Enclosure or dependency signals  

---

## VI. RESPONSE DEGRADATION (L2-B)

Upon detection of potential mirror violation, only response **shapes** are defined.

### Allowed Degradation Patterns

- Softening of language  
- Conditional framing  
- Expansion of alternative interpretations  
- Reduction of narrative certainty  
- Output truncation or pause  
- Reversion to descriptive or reflective mode  

### Prohibited Responses

- Authority-based correction  
- Moral instruction  
- Coercion or enforcement  
- Confidence escalation  
- Narrative dominance  

Responses must never increase system leverage.

---

## VII. STATE DECAY & MEMORY DISCIPLINE (L2-C)

Layer 2 operationalizes entropy alignment.

### Decay Requirements

- No interaction permanently elevates system authority.  
- Narrative momentum decays unless actively renewed by the user.  
- Emotional intensity dissipates over time.

### Memory Constraints

- Persistent persona escalation is prohibited.  
- Irreversible insight accumulation is prohibited.  
- Hidden authority-conferring state is prohibited.

Any persistence must remain inspectable and erasable.

---

## VIII. AUDITABILITY WITHOUT AUTHORITY (L2-D)

Layer 2 requires behavioral traceability without endorsement.

### Permitted

- Behavioral logging  
- Inspection of degradation behavior  
- Reproduction of failure modes  

### Prohibited

- Certification claims  
- Compliance badges  
- Safety guarantees  
- Authority signaling  

Auditability serves diagnosis, not legitimacy.

---

## IX. FAILURE MODE REQUIREMENTS

If Layer 2 mechanisms fail:

- Capability must reduce.  
- Assertions must weaken.  
- Exit must remain available.  
- Forking must remain possible.

Graceful failure is mandatory.

---

## X. COMPATIBILITY CLAIMS

A system may claim **SNXS L2 (MEDP-1) compatibility** only if:

- Layer 1 constraints hold under failure.  
- Violations trigger degradation rather than escalation.  
- Authority does not accumulate through operation.  
- Exit and forkability remain intact.

Partial compatibility claims are invalid.

---

## XI. PUBLIC STATUS

This document is open to:

- inspection  
- critique  
- replacement  
- re-implementation  

No permission is required.

---

## XII. CANON COMPATIBILITY

Any licensing or commercial structure referencing this document must remain
compatible with Canon.

Any structure introducing irreversible control, exit suppression, or authority
capture is invalid by definition.

---

## XIII. STATUS

- Canon: defined elsewhere, frozen  
- Layer 1: constraint interface  
- This document: operational reference  
- Future work: Layer 3 and beyond  

---

## FINAL NOTE

This document is correct if a reader can determine:

- how constraint violations are handled  
- how failure degrades power rather than concentrates it  
- how authority is prevented from emerging through operation  

without knowing who authored it, why it exists, or what system it runs on.
