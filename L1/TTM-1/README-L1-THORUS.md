SNXS-L1 — THE THORUS MYCELIUM

A Non-Canonical Coordination Mesh for Anti-Capture Systems

Status: Public · Non-Canonical · Forkable
Constraint Authority: SNXS-L0 (Frozen Canon)
Author: Allan T. Hartojo (Originating Implementer)
Purpose: Experimental coordination, economic onboarding, and research continuity

Overview

SNXS-L1: The Thorus Mycelium is a non-canonical Layer-1 implementation of the SNXS constraint framework.

It is not a protocol, not governance, and not an investment system.

This repository exists to document and publish a flow-based coordination model designed to:
	•	Prevent permanent accumulation
	•	Prevent authority crystallization
	•	Preserve universal exit and forkability
	•	Stabilize growth through circulation and decay rather than enforcement

The implementation described here does not modify the frozen SNXS-L0 Canon.

What This Is (and Is Not)

This is:
	•	A research implementation
	•	A coordination model
	•	An economic onboarding experiment
	•	A forkable, non-canonical artifact
	•	A documentation anchor for deployments and NFTs

This is not:
	•	A constitution
	•	A governance charter
	•	A technical protocol specification
	•	A promise of yield or appreciation
	•	A canonical extension of SNXS-L0

Participation is voluntary.
Exit is always possible.
Forking requires no permission.

Conceptual Summary

The Thorus Mycelium models coordination as circulation, not control.

Key principles include:
	•	Mandatory Decay
Advantage degrades over time unless renewed through contribution.
	•	No Irreversible Control
No role, actor, or mechanism may acquire permanent dominance.
	•	Epistemic Shielding (Mirror Constraint Interface)
The system describes flow behavior, not authoritative truth.
	•	Voluntary Participation
Entry, exit, and disengagement must always remain possible.
	•	Forking as a Success Condition
Capture is avoided by making forking easier than control.

Stability emerges from entropy and circulation, not governance or enforcement.

Economic Onboarding (Non-Canonical)

Some deployments may use NFT-based license artifacts to coordinate access, participation, or brand usage.

These artifacts:
	•	Do not grant governance authority
	•	Do not guarantee yield or profit
	•	Do not imply appreciation
	•	Do not restrict exit or forking

All economic parameters (pricing, quantities, percentages) are:
	•	Deployment-specific
	•	Explicitly non-canonical
	•	Mutable
	•	Forkable

They exist to connect theory with reality — not to bind future states.

Forking & Usage

You are free to:
	•	Fork this repository
	•	Write alternative implementations
	•	Deploy incompatible parameters
	•	Abandon the model entirely

Constraints may be inherited.
Obligations are not.

If the system does not fit your needs, fork it.

Final Note

This work is correct if the reader can determine:
	•	What must decay
	•	What must never become permanent
	•	What must always remain forkable

…without knowing:
	•	Who controls the system
	•	Who benefits most
	•	Who remains in charge

If those questions cannot be answered, the implementation has failed.
