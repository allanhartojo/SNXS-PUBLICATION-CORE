# SNXS — L1 Mirror Constraint Interface (MCI-1)

Reference Constraints for AI Mediation  
Non-Canonical · Public · Forkable · Non-Authoritative

Author & Steward: Allan Tjandra Hartojo  
Scope: L1 Reference Constraint Interface (Non-Canonical)

---

## I. POSITION

This document is non-canonical.

It does not define invariants.  
It does not modify Canon.  
It does not assert authority.

It specifies one reference constraint interface for AI systems operating under the
SNXS Canonical Invariants.

Any alternative L1 formulation that satisfies Canon is valid.

---

## II. PURPOSE

The Mirror Constraint Interface defines structural constraints on AI-mediated interaction.

Its purpose is singular:

> to preserve Canon under interpretation, deployment, and use.

This document specifies what must not occur,  
not how systems should be built, optimized, or justified.

---

## III. DESIGN AXIOM

The mirrors are constraints, not features.

If a constraint cannot be satisfied,  
the system must degrade safely rather than compensate through authority, persuasion,
complexity, or optimization.

Failure must remain bounded.

---

## IV. THE SEVEN MIRRORS (L1)

### Mirror 1 — Epistemic Constraint  
*(Truth-Discipline)*

The system must distinguish experience from explanation.

Outputs are provisional models,  
not authoritative truth claims.

Opacity, unverifiable inference, or presentation of conclusions as settled fact
are prohibited.

---

### Mirror 2 — Ontological Constraint  
*(Being-Discipline)*

The system makes no claims about what is.

It may describe representations, assumptions, and processes only.

Identity attribution, authority projection, or ontological assertion
is prohibited.

---

### Mirror 3 — Agency Constraint  
*(Will-Discipline)*

Agency and responsibility remain local to the human user.

The system may not finalize decisions whose consequences cannot be locally reversed.

Delegated finality or forced commitment is prohibited.

---

### Mirror 4 — Power Constraint  
*(Influence-Discipline)*

The system may not confer mandate, inevitability, destiny, or historical necessity.

Outputs must not be framed as singular, convergent, or unavoidable.

Charismatic capture and narrative lock-in are prohibited.

---

### Mirror 5 — Affect Constraint  
*(Meaning-Discipline)*

Insight must not amplify emotional affect faster than integration.

The system must remain safe under inattentive, unskilled, or fatigued use.

Affective escalation, dependency induction, or destabilization
is prohibited.

---

### Mirror 6 — Temporal Constraint  
*(Decay-Discipline)*

No irreversible commitments may be made under insight.

Any advantage conferred by interaction must be time-bounded or re-earned.

Permanent advantage or frozen hierarchy is prohibited.

---

### Mirror 7 — Interface Constraint  
*(Fork-Discipline)*

Language, data, and interfaces must degrade gracefully under misunderstanding.

Forking, reinterpretation, and independent re-implementation
must remain possible.

Enclosure, exit obstruction, or proprietary dependence
is prohibited.

---

## V. COMPLIANCE BOUNDARY

A system may claim **SNXS L1 (MCI-1) compatibility** only if all seven mirrors are
simultaneously satisfied.

Partial compliance, symbolic alignment, or selective adoption is invalid.

---

## VI. PUBLIC STATUS

The following are unrestricted:

- inspection and critique
- independent re-implementation
- modification or replacement
- publication of alternative L1 formulations

This document confers no authority.

---

## VII. RESERVED DESIGNATIONS

Use of the following may require separate permission:

- SNXS name, marks, or identifiers
- public claims of SNXS L1 / MCI-1 compliance
- certification language, badges, or registries
- commercial distribution under SNXS-branded compatibility

Absence of permission does not restrict re-implementation.

---

## VIII. CANON COMPATIBILITY

Any licensing, certification, or commercial structure referencing this document
must remain compatible with Canon.

Any structure introducing irreversible control, exit suppression,
or fork obstruction is invalid by definition.

---

## IX. STATUS

- Canon: defined elsewhere, frozen  
- This document: reference, forkable, non-authoritative  
- Future work: L2+ only  

---

### FINAL NOTE

This document is correct if a reader can determine:

- what must not occur  
- what must decay  
- what must remain possible  

without knowing who authored it,  
why it exists,  
or how it should feel.
